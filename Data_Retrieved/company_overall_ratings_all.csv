Travel policy is that the employee has to pay for their own flights and hotel, OK this is reimbursed but still asking employees to book their own is asking them for 1000's to be shed out upfront. This needs to change as it discourages travel between office locations.

The San Ramon Engineering team are very poor in skills, productivity and morale. They separate Dev from QA and then call themselves Agile! The Snr Director's in engineering are causing more roadblocks to progress than anything else - they are not leaders or visionaries, but so reactionary the strategy changes every 2 weeks. This constant zig-zagging actually means that nothing really gets done.

There is no career structure for employees in Engineering. HR is really weak on providing meaningful career level and opportunities. This is actually embarrassing when hiring new people, and they ask ""What is the future of this role?""

The last of the four managers I wasn't even notified was my new manager until they called me and introduced them self as my new manager. Of the four, not one of them could consistently answer phone calls or emails citing everything from meetings and holidays, meaning there's no handoff, to phone and computer problems, which is odd for an IT outsourcing company riddled with so many IT problems. 

After five weeks of asking what day we're paid on and getting no response, I had to threaten to walk off the job before I was offered an ""apology bonus"" to keep me on site for another week until I was paid. As far as benefits go, Allied offered none as with most outsourcing firms but the final straw was when I noticed extra deductions from my paycheck and was then informed that the company no longer pays for sick days meaning two and a half days pay were deducted from my salary after the fact, with no prior notice and in direct breach of my contract as a permanent employee. 

These are just the major points of why you should avoid working for Allied Worldwide as a whole, but aside from which there were multiple pay disputes, taxation issues and a disjointed managerial structure in general. The hassle of working for this lacklustre company isn't nearly worth the less than average pay and total lack of benefits they offer.",1.0,,2016-09-08 12:47:42.783,False,IT Administrator,,IT Services,200064.0,Information Technology,10013.0,True

* Toilets are clean and fresh like in 5* hotels 
* Workers are easy to manage and respectful, great hard-working people, pride of our company.
* Open door policy is a great way of resolving any issues as they arise. Any worker can come to production office any time and describe his/her problem if there is any so we can take fast action in order to resolve it nice and immediately.  Thanks to this policy there is no need for external mediators that seemingly want to help poor workers but the real purpose behind it is to sneak inside the organization and steal away our ideas, infiltrate and sell information to our competitors.","* Canteen for production workers could be closer to production lines, this would maximize the time spent by workers on production lines and could contribute to even higher efficiency throughout our facility.

High achievers, but with a respect for work/life balance. 
I can't think of one person that I interact with at Boxever who does not do their job to the best of their ability and with integrity.  There is a lot of fun to be had and great personalities, but I feel that people really take pride in doing a good job.  That is a great atmosphere to be around.  
The culture is one of moving forward even if you can't always deliver perfection.  So that if there is a misstep, it is dealt with and people move ahead.  Best efforts are still seen as a win and there is an understanding and encouragement when there are areas of improvement.  
Questions to team members and senior staff are met with respect and openness, and similarly.  Issues that need to be addressed are always presented constructively and thoughtfully.  
Lots of emphasis on balance in the workplace.  Examples: Sports & Social events, Lunch & Learns for growth, pool table and patio, as well as alternative work stations, flexible hours, parental leave options, health insurance as well as other incentives.","Still a growing company, as things grow systems will need to get tighter and more streamlined.

While everyone is entitled to their opinion I wholeheartedly disagree with them. I am currently employed in the Finance Dept. for the past eight months so I thought I would put down in writing for all to see what my experience to-date is.

Positives;
•	Always a friendly atmosphere.
•	Morale within Finance and the overall company is fantastic.
•	Great working conditions.
•	Great people.
•	Growing Company.
•	Excellent team members and team spirit. 
•	Excellent Career progression.
•	Flexible with annual leave.
•	Compassionate employer.
•	Pension & Healthcare related benefits are very good.

Not only are the above points 100% true, there is a willingness from Senior Management to assist you in any way possible. They are always approachable, will go above and beyond to assist you and will mentor/coach you to ensure that you can progress to the betterment of your own career and personal goals.  The company is growing as can be seen with two acquisitions within the last year which is not only exciting it shows to me they want to be market leaders in their field and the firm of choice in Consultancy Engineering.

Yes, the job is challenging (whose job isn’t?) but with the help and assistance of the team I work with as well as a massive onus been put on team ethic, we all help each other. 

In conclusion, my time here in ByrneLooby has been great, I thoroughly enjoy my job, the people I work with and report to so I couldn’t ask for anything better. If you want to pursue a career be it in Finance or Consultancy Engineering I would highly recommend working here.",In all honesty no cons at all.,4.0,,2017-05-17 03:36:37.553,True,Employee,,Construction,200036.0,"Construction, Repair & Maintenance",10007.0,True

1) Your commute can be as short as the distance between your bed and your desk. In my case, it's 15 meters. 
2) More quality time with family & friends
3) Ability to travel - or even move- to your favourite countries/cities!
4) A certain flexibility to plan your day- very difficult to achieve in traditional companies. 

On a personal level, joining Crossover allowed me to do the following:
1) move back to my home country ( with a decent wage to live on)
2) Take up surfing. I can literally go for a surf in the middle of the day. Brilliant, innit?
3) I'm living in a sunny country now- very important for my productivity.

Crossover is a very competitive but ""transparent"" place to work in , metrics are clear, people are  great.","- no after-work drinks:) Regional ""get together"" initiatives started recently though
- more diversified management ( cultural and educational background) to reflect the truly global nature of the company...There's a transformation going on so thumbs up there!

Many people complain that they give bad roles, those are for those who are not willing to prove themselves and work hard, if you work hard, FD will be a great place to progress because you will be put on a wonderful role. 

Financial engineers/ consultants are expected to complete your PRMIA exams which is all paid by the firm. PRM is much tougher and technical compared to FRM administered by GARP, and you are surely hot cake if you can complete all 4 PRMIA exams and FD pays for your all 4 exams. Some others decide to write the CISI exams, its usually for those with a law background. 

Salary- Personally, standalone the salary looks small for graduates. Although, when you realize you are taxed less by UK gov cos you are on the lower bracket you will be earning more than those in middle office and back office analyst in the banks after tax, plus all expense are paid when you are on a client site, that's a very generous salary for the first year. If they wish to increase it in future that would be much appreciated. 

Accommodations.

This is by far the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of working for.,"Where do I start? I only wish that I could have found a review from a previous employee on glassdoor. 

I had my suspicions of what type of working environment I might find myself working in from the interview stage. I was interviewed 3 separate times by 3 different people in one day all asking the same questions which lasted for a ridiculous 1 hour and 20 minutes. For my second interview I was asked to buy and read the book titled ""how to win friends and influence people"" which I did but was not asked anything at all about the book at my second interview. Complete waste of my time and money. Second interview was essentially the same as first interview but with a role play. I was also asked to buy a second book before starting work, which I did and was also never asked to produce this again. More money wasted.

When researching the company before interview, all I could find was a couple of bad reviews on Google from a past client and candidate. I tried to put these negative comments out of my head but after starting work here, it didn't take long to find out that those couple of comments actually painted quite a good picture of what this place is about. 

I also found out that the company has been around for roughly 10 years and had only 3 employees. 1 is the owner, another is the owners sister and another has been there around 4 years. I couldn't help thinking why a company that has been around for so long had so few employees, but I soon found out. 

There is no training to speak of whatsoever (certainly not what I would consider training) There is no reviewing progress as you go along or constructive feedback given. I imagine the reason for this is that they have had so many people come and go that if they have ever given decent training, they had definitely given up. I was also told that they had went through at least a dozen trainees in a 6 month period before I started. Quite a high number considering the size of the business. Since leaving I have learned that their attempt to open a second office in Belfast has failed. This is no surprise as i've seen how they manage new employees. 

Atmosphere is extremely uncomfortable, boring and no sense of team spirit. There is always a very obvious tension in the room which does not make for a pleasant working environment. I have personally never worked in a more uncomfortable environment and hope I never will again. 

They are extremely unwelcoming to new employees and as much as I tried to build a relationship with my new co-workers, I could tell that my efforts were neither appreciated or welcomed. 

There is an unspoken rule that no-one goes home until the boss goes home even though the ""official"" finishing time is 6. If the boss is still there at 6.30 then you must be also. Everyone literally waits until he leaves before finishing up. Also extremely uncomfortable.

The way the everyone talks about their clients and candidates is extremely unprofessional and derogatory in some cases. I found this particularly hard to listen to on a daily basis.

There is a strong focus on values self-organisation and self-management. People are trusted, and expected to do the right thing.  Salary and benefits are very good and linked to your performance in a very fair and reasonable way.  Growth in the Dublin office has been really strong over the last few years, and will continue for the foreseeable future. 

Product Development teams are setup for success as self-organising 'pods' that define and run their own Agile practices and processes.  These pods are generally about 5 to 8 people with a product manager, 3 to 5 engineers and 1 to 2 QAs.  Pods are collected into tribes with specific purposes.

Product Development in Dublin covers 3 main areas: 
(1) Digital, which encompasses  the online 'Digital' aspects of the product set delivering a set of online digital experiences targeted at different roles.  
(2) Suite - which covers the engineering and delivery of elements the underlying product suite.
(3) Content - delivers market specific enhancements of the product for specific regional markets.","I would say that in Guidewire Product Development there aren't many cons.  It's a really great place to work.  

If pushed the only cons I would list are around the maturity of the products.

We have been developing these products for nearly  2 decades, there is a lot of existing software.  This has been developed and enhanced over many years.  Some areas of the product suite are more modern than others, some have been modernised, some  haven't.  This can present a challenge for people looking to develop 'green fields' applications.  As we  grow and develop we tackle these challenges but it's not the same as starting with a blank sheet.

The only other con worth a mention is the use of a internal language Gosu.  It's a java like language that provided access to key language features before they were available in Java.  It's straight forward but if you are very sensitive to with language you use, this might be a turn off.  Most strong engineers are not bothered by this - it's just another C-like language.",5.0,"Dublin, Co. Dublin (Ireland)",2017-10-10 03:36:06.78,True,Software Engineering Manager,"Dublin, Co.

From an engineering point of view you get to work with the latest technologies and deal with problems at scale. Work life balance is the best in any company I have worked for.

They also have a summer program to get up to 5 Fridays off by working flex time. Great city centre location, nice new office and free coffee. Close to gym and they have showers and secure bike location. There has been a lot of churn at senior management level but the current incumbents are respected and I feel the company is on the right track.",This is not a very hierarchical company which means that different teams can tend to pursue their own objectives - this is not ideal and leads to a non-aligned and competing product vision and way too many meetings.

This means that there is a lot of office banter and experience isn't necessary. 

- Fire engineering follows a pretty standard routine to comply with Building Regulations. Although this means that it is difficult to be creative at times, management are very happy to allow staff to show off their creative abilities when called for. 

- The annual conference is always a nice way to meet the team in other offices. JGA very generously pays for transport, accommodation and meals as part of this weekend away. 

- Learn-by-doing approach to training means that engineers feel useful from the very beginning. 

- Management have your back at all times, and will help with any issues that you are struggling with. This is the biggest advantage of the company structure, wherein all members of management have worked their way through the ranks from design engineers. 

- Since most staff are hired as design engineers and promoted from within, the career advancement opportunities are amazing.","- Clients/architects often do not understand that engineers have multiple projects at once, and make unreasonable deadlines. Although this is unavoidable in the construction industry, management are great at looking out for the staff when it comes to tough deadlines. 

- Projects often go on hold and restart with little or no warning, meaning that engineers are at times under a lot of pressure. It can be difficult at times to get assistance with this, but management are usually quick to address unreasonable deadlines and help make sure that each engineer has the resources that they need.

- The strict quality control policies often slow down the issuing of projects, as everything has to be checked and approved by two separate members of staff. As all staff are often busy and under pressure themselves, there can be a bit of a backlog when it comes to checking. 

- Since the office is in the city centre, commuting can be very difficult at peak times. 

- When project deadlines are looming, it is sometimes necessary to put in overtime into the evenings or early in the morning.",4.0,"Dublin, Co. Dublin (Ireland)",2017-12-08 03:51:37.71,False,Senior Design Engineer,"Dublin, Co. Dublin (Ireland)",,,,,False

If you are looking for a job where you are dealing with professional and intelligent people, which take their work seriously and are passionate about the products, you have come to the right place . The team is a mixture of all ages and nationalities and the  atmosphere is one of mutual respect and helpfulness. People sell well, because they believe in the product, and there is a complete lack of the  ultra-competitive ,aggressive sales mentality  and rivalry that poison so many sales environments. Territories are clear and well organised, and there is advise and coaching but no micro-management. 

You never stop learning at MathWorks, and if you like Science and Computing, you are in heaven. The Managers are fair and they are ""proper"" managers, that care about their team and have the experience. MathWorks is a no-nonsense , friendly company with dedicated , hard-working employees. The salary and benefits are good and get better, the longer you are with MathWorks. Unlike a lot of the very ""young, fast and short-lived""  sales jobs,  MathWorks provides a  stable, mature and steadily growing  team and a nice ,modern office right in the Centre of Galway.

I travelled to very interesting places and worked with awesome clients. I made a handful of great friends and I'm very thankful for what I was able to learn here.,"The company is horrible. They treat their employees as if they were expendable. The culture is completely rotten, and they have a very strong favoritism thing going on. If you're on someone's good side, you're ok. But if you're not, you're never going anywhere - or maybe you are: you're out! They never protect their employeez, I even escalated one directot who was legitimately harrasing me, doing everything in his power to make me fail, lying about me, even generating gossip as if work was a highschool, and what did HR do? Nothing. I emailed his boss directly detailing the last recount of his transgressions, he ignored my email and instead called me on the phone because he knew that was the only way to ""calm down"" the situation and NOT leave any records, all trying to protect him. This director dared tell me in a meeting with other witnesses that I had to work more hours (I was already working 14 hour days) to ""justify"" the company's investment in sending me to a different location for a project (when there was a business need for me to be there). I suffered the worst treatment in this company, I was yelled at many times, insultes by my leaders, only because they are ""oldschool"" and completely lack emotional intelligence and the abilith to fuction as good leaders under stress. It's a company stuck in the past. For 4 years of my life I was overworked, underpaid and mistreated. This company lets bullies get away with it. It's disgusting. Every smart person I know that still works here wants to leave as soon as possible.",1.0,,2017-02-25 18:15:21.607,False,Senior Manager,,Staffing & Outsourcing,200032.0,Business Services,10006.0,False

Some companies have wishy washy missions statements about culture, diversity and values and do hardly anything to evidence this.

Not here at New Relic! They wear their hearts of their sleeve and adhere to the principles they want to follow: Honesty & Authenticity, Integrity, Diversity and Gender and GBLT Equality. A true Meritocracy! The tone of any company is set right at the very top by its leadership team and flows down right down to the bottom. Relic have got this right and have somehow managed to maintain that true start up spirit of one team and great culture and nurtured it and brought out the best of it and grown with! Its so easy to lose this and just become yet another corporate.

A few living examples of this of what I hear people around me consistently say: "" I have everything I want here"" ""My manager is great and gives me flexibility and space"" ""this is the greatest company I have ever worked for, I LOVE IT"". The greatest asset of any company is it's people. Relic value and recognise this. Also ... I hear ""Do the right thing by your customers, make them successful and you will in turn be successful"". My last employer was completely the opposite to this and a huge mistake! Unfortunately it's human nature to not call out good things or really appreciate them when you have them, only when you no longer have them!. 

I have not even mentioned the Product yet. I will the marketing department do that as they they are more eloquent than me: but the platform, It's roots and the way Relic continues to delight it's customers is AMAZING!

The CEO is special and one of it's greatest assets; some one who inspires people and has charisma and is a real genius! My last CEO was completely the opposite to this was robotic by comparison.  He also has a litmus test for hiring people ""would I share a car journey with this person"": in other words you need to be a cultural fit to work at New Relic. ""love your Mondays""  I hear him saying, in other words love what you do, and if you don't, go find something that will. Sorry Lew, giving away the secret sauce!!

The new shiny, amazing, inspirational, wonderful EMEA HQ Dublin office is nearly worthy of all the wonderful people that work in it!","The positives far outweigh any of the negative experiences: 'Stuff' happens sometimes, that's life. Somethings could always be better or don't make sense and nothing is ever perfect! Can you effect change to improve things....yes you can here!

I found that the training they deliver truly is outstanding and it serves you well not only in this job, but in future professions. 

Refusal to hire externally. This IS a good idea. Their trainees become team leaders, managers, directors etc. This is a great thing and should be done more often in other companies.","Where to begin......

I must say that all comments are completely my own opinion. 

Whilst I was there, we had a Questions/Answer session with one of the Directors. We submitted our questions anonymously beforehand. One question was why they ask us to do so much overtime and UNPAID. What really frustrated me was their complete avoidance of answering this question and they gave an answer any politician would be proud of. The Czech Labor Law states that it is illigal to work more than 5 consecutive days in the Czech Republic, yet they are ""encouraging"" us to work across weekends. If you didn't work on weekends like myself (I had no desire/push to do so) you were looked down upon as a ""part-timer"". 

It sucks the energy from you. After making hundreds of calls a week and working an additional couple of hours every night, you naturally want to relax on a weekend....not work more. Work-Life balance is key. I think, literally a handful of employees were married. It is not a Job for someone with a family. You have no balance at all. 

It is hectic environment but feels like a school. You have to have lunch between certain times and you feel bad even making a coffee out of the regulated breaks. 

The staff turnover is absolutely astonishing. From the group who started alongside myself, only 2 remain as far as I am aware. 

Unprofessional. In my opinion, NonStop is the most Unprofessional Professional company I have come across. You have to dress formally (suits) when there is no need to. Furthermore, the attitude and lifestyles of some of the employees are utterly disgraceful and I can say that they would certainly struggle in most other companies. 

Wages. They try to incentivize you to make sales by paying you a very low sum of money per month. It does not work in my opinion at all. The first few months in Prague, your salary is so low you honestly find it difficult to get by.",2.0,,2017-06-21 06:50:03.573,False,Employee,,Staffing & Outsourcing,200032.0,Business Services,10006.0,True

It's also the first place I've come across where there's a career path for people who don't want to manage people but still want to progress. Which is great as I want to get on but I couldn't handle even the thought of managing people.
They're very good at supporting staff when it comes to self-development, further education and training and career planning.
People are expected to work hard but there's a brilliant ethos in terms of work-life balance. People do their stuff and go home to their families, there's no stupidity about trying to work people to death. There's also great holidays and - shock horror! - people are urged to take them!
Despite the rapid growth over the past couple of years, there's a lovely atmosphere to the place, a great sense of fun and people treated each other with respect.
In other places I worked there was a lot of BS from the top about listening to the workers and I thought it would be the same here, but it's definitely not. The CEO is a very open guy and really goes out of his way to talk to people and listen to what they have to say, and then take action. I wasn't surprised when it was named the best company in Ireland for listening to its employees this year. Well deserved.","Not a lot really.  Just some of the usual issues that come when a place is growing so fast and sometimes it seems we're running off our feet. It's exciting but if you like a more leisurely pace it probably wouldn't be the place for you right now. 
There's the usual moaners and groaners that you get everywhere blaming management for this and for that, but thankfully they're in a very small minority, though you still wouldn't want to be stuck sitting next to one of them for a while, like I was.

Flexible work-life balance
Good salary and benefits
Great team
Great atmosphere

I don't normally comment on these sites but when I read some recent reviews I felt I had to give a more balanced view. 

If the person who thought it was the worst place to work at (from the March 8th review) then why did you stay so long. If your who I think you are, then your negativity and constant complaining are not missed in the office. If anything we all wanted to throw a party on the floor when you left.
Like any company going through change, there are many challenges and most of us didnâ€™t like or approve of them, but the atmosphere in the office is fantastic now with everyone working together to help each other.
For those reading the previous negative review, just know that this review is from someone who was constantly negative and always looked for other people to blame for what they were doing.

A lot of new people have come in and a lot of the negative poor performing people have gone who made it a poor atmosphere to work in, but that has all changed recently.

Its not a perfect place to work by no means and has its challenges -  high workloads and high expectations (sometimes unrealistic), but it has some really great aspects to it and has good rewards.
If anyone wants a true review of what it is like to work at Quest Support, pick up the phone and ring the helpdesk and ask one of us.","Lots of change

- Lack of progression. Even if you have a lot of industry experience and work great in your department, any advancement in your career is hindered by your qualifications (i.e lack of a PHD), and whether management like you personally or not.
- No sick days, pension or maternity pay
- No benefits at all really! The only benefit is that you can take a maximum of 2hours flexi time per month but even if you have worked 5hours extra, only 2 hours are permitted to be taken.
- Clock in and out system is too strict.
- Working hours are 40hours a week where you start 20minutes early and finish 20minutes later (8.40am-5.20pm) to account for your 40minute unpaid break.
- No structure for salary progression or appraisals.

This area of Dublin is only going to get better with the new building work that is going on around the office.

Realex is a fantastic place to grow your career if you're willing to apply yourself. You'll be working with some very best people and the latest technology. On occasion you may have to dabble with some older tech so you'll be getting a wide variety of experience. 

Realex lately are quite flexible in terms of the work environment, having recently renovated the desktops in favour of laptops, there are quite a few people working remotely when it better suits them. There seems to be a lot of opportunity for travel if you're in to that.

Free coffee and lots of free fruit.  Occasionally there is beer and pizza in the office while someone gets to show off something clever that they've been working on. 

Great social aspect to working at Realex, you'll probably be out on the tear with your colleagues a lot.

Sports and Social have a healthy budget too, for company social events, they organise all sorts from Secret Santa, to charity based events, to cinema trips and the odd drinking session.","The open plan office can be a bit counter productive sometimes and for the number of people in the Dublin office it can be a bit cramped in certain areas and at certain times.  It's  fine if you get yourself a pair of noise cancelling headphones. 

The laptop screens are ultra low resolution, so despite having the mobility, you're tied to your desk. No breaking away for some quiet time.

I had direct access to the clients, so I could learn why they were building what they were building, rather than just picking ""souless"" tickets from a Jira board everyday.  This also gave me experience dealing with non-tech people directly, which has helped me greatly to this day.

The company invests in product development but also on people (benefits & perks). If you want to develop and up-skill there are a ton of resources and benefits that allow for that.
You can work on projects that are relevant to you and play to your strengths.
Work environment personally is fantastic. It was a true wonder the crazy amount of great people I've worked with throughout the years, and the type of supportive atmosphere I experienced.
The usual tech perks are in play (catered everything, beautiful office space, amazing events).
I never felt work was repetitive because the product itself is quite diverse.
There was always room for process innovation and out of the box thinking was encouraged (very specific to my position/experience/ Took a lot of work to actually push changes sometimes related to lack of resources, but it sure was encouraged).","This is not a con per se, but over the years I felt this was a topic of discontent for many people. Because it is still a very flat (and developing) org, it takes quite a lot of commitment and work to move (upwards and sideways).  If you are looking for an easy way up or a quick career change you will be disappointed. For me, this was never an issue as my motivators/rewards are not associated with movement but with development opportunities instead. Younger generations need to understand not everything happens at the speed of light...
There is still a lot to be done, to develop a unique corporate cultural entity - ""Company culture"" is thrown left right and centre but I did not feel it meant the same throughout the org. (also not necessarily a con). While there are a set of company values, every department ended up living by a different set of values and work culture. 
Additionally, the company doesn't take advantage of each office's uniqueness. I.e.: social/experience events and initiatives are pushed top down, and there seems to be little room to do things locally without it being overly scrutinized or shut down because it can't be pushed org . wide (or so was my perception). Things that made sense and were meaningful celebrations (or ways to celebrate) in the main office were pushed to other locations with (what seemed) little regard for relevance, and sometimes initiatives fell flat because of that.",4.0,"Dublin, Co.

A company with huge self belief that it can make a difference - not just for a client's business but for staff and for the community at large... that's why so many people stay long term. We have a 10 year club (considering the company is only 15 years old... that's saying something). Having been with the company for four years, I'm pretty sure I'll still be here at 10. So why is that? Really it's because everybody gives a s*** - literally everybody! They care about the individual - in and out of work. You will be supported, encouraged, congratulated, rewarded and challenged. You will push yourself to do the very best for your clients - because that's what we all do, because we want to. You will laugh, throw dodgy dance moves, enjoy your extra four days holidays at Christmas, feel like you belong to a big (slightly crazy) family who is really going places. So get on the bus and join us - you won't regret it!",I've nothing to say here,5.0,,2016-12-14 04:43:42.827,True,Employee,,Advertising & Marketing,200022.0,Business Services,10006.0,True

Some companies have wishy washy missions statements about culture, diversity and values and do hardly anything to evidence this.

Not here at New Relic! They wear their hearts of their sleeve and adhere to the principles they want to follow: Honesty & Authenticity, Integrity, Diversity and Gender and GBLT Equality. A true Meritocracy! The tone of any company is set right at the very top by its leadership team and flows down right down to the bottom. Relic have got this right and have somehow managed to maintain that true start up spirit of one team and great culture and nurtured it and brought out the best of it and grown with! Its so easy to lose this and just become yet another corporate.

A few living examples of this of what I hear people around me consistently say: "" I have everything I want here"" ""My manager is great and gives me flexibility and space"" ""this is the greatest company I have ever worked for, I LOVE IT"". The greatest asset of any company is it's people. Relic value and recognise this. Also ... I hear ""Do the right thing by your customers, make them successful and you will in turn be successful"". My last employer was completely the opposite to this and a huge mistake! Unfortunately it's human nature to not call out good things or really appreciate them when you have them, only when you no longer have them!. 

I have not even mentioned the Product yet. I will the marketing department do that as they they are more eloquent than me: but the platform, It's roots and the way Relic continues to delight it's customers is AMAZING!

The CEO is special and one of it's greatest assets; some one who inspires people and has charisma and is a real genius! My last CEO was completely the opposite to this was robotic by comparison.  He also has a litmus test for hiring people ""would I share a car journey with this person"": in other words you need to be a cultural fit to work at New Relic. ""love your Mondays""  I hear him saying, in other words love what you do, and if you don't, go find something that will. Sorry Lew, giving away the secret sauce!!

The new shiny, amazing, inspirational, wonderful EMEA HQ Dublin office is nearly worthy of all the wonderful people that work in it!","The positives far outweigh any of the negative experiences: 'Stuff' happens sometimes, that's life. Somethings could always be better or don't make sense and nothing is ever perfect! Can you effect change to improve things....yes you can here!

Do need to take more ownership and feedback with regards to optimising the workforce: growing pains and will happen soon, I'm sure",5.0,"Dublin, Co.
